Project for the course "Signal Processing"

Problem 1): Echo Creation
        Given an audio signal, created echoes using filters

Problem 2): Echo Cancellation
        Given audio signal contaoning echo, generated an algorithm to cancel echo using autocorrelation and adaptive filters

Problem 3): Noise Classification
        Developed an algorithm using correlation for classifying noise in an audio signal
